# Fastly MCP Agent Structure

This directory stores playbooks used by the workspace custom agent for maintaining this Fastly API MCP server.

## Contents

- `playbooks/service-onboarding.md`: Step-by-step checklist for adding a new service integration to the MCP skeleton.
- `templates/service-spec.md`: Structured input template for describing a new service integration request.
- `.github/prompts/adapt-skeleton-service.prompt.md`: Agent-mode prompt for running structured service adaptation tasks from chat.

## How It Is Used

The VS Code custom agent at `.github/agents/skeleton-services-mcp.agent.md` uses this material as implementation guidance when asked to:

- Add or extend Fastly API operations
- Expose service operations as MCP tools
- Keep security defaults (redaction and authorization)
- Preserve dual transport behavior (stdio and HTTP)
- Preserve HTTP auth modes (token, oauth2, both)
- Keep secrets in Vault and config in Postgres
- Maintain multi-tenant defaults (Vault token fallback tenant/user or tenant/account and Postgres config tenant/principal defaults)
- Preserve Vault Raft persistence patterns in both local and production compose stacks
- Preserve bearer-token seeding for user access provisioning, exposed both as a CLI helper and an MCP tool
- Preserve OAuth access-token seeding for user access provisioning, exposed both as a CLI helper and an MCP tool
- Preserve startup ordering that runs the managed unseal key init helper before Vault starts
- Preserve support for external Vault and Postgres services via app-only compose startup
- Treat `APP_NAME` as the single naming source for Vault token paths and Postgres config table names, with tenant/principal segments nested underneath
- Add tests and documentation updates
